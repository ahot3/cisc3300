1. A class defines properties and methods (variables & functions), and serves as a blueprint for creating objects, which are an instance of a class that have actual values assigned to the properties previously defined in the class. OOP stands for object oriented programming which is a programming model that organizes software design around objects and data (hence, object oriented), focusing on encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism.
2. Reasons to use an abstract class in OOP are that is ensures that its child classes implement the required methods, provides a base structure for its child classes and prevents direct instantiation of the abstract class itself.
3. Superglobals are predefined built in variables that can be accessed anywhere regardless of scope.
4. Defining the class in a namespace and then using the namespace in another file.
5. MVC (which stands for model view controller) is a design pattern/methodology which separates logic into three parts. The first being model which handles the data, second being view which handles UI/HTML and third being controller which handles the requests and connects the previous two.
6. a. /users, GET
b. /users/{id}, GET
c. /users, POST
d. /users{id}, PUT
e. /users{id}, DELETE
