1. Hoisting: when variables and functions are moved to the top of the scope.
Closures: a function that remembers the variables from its parent scope, which happens even after the parent completes execution.
2. PHP is a server-side scripting language that is used for handling backend logic and dynamic web pages. We use server-side languages to process form submissions, generate HTML dynamically and handle database interactions.
3. They're similar in that they both support functions, loops, conditionals. Both can handle form inputs and validation. But they're different in that JS is client-side while PHP is server-side. Also, the syntax for variables such as $variables in PHP and let/const in JS.
4. Because PHP is faster for small projects like the ones we work on, has easier deployment on shared hosting and has built in support for web development.
5. Echo prints text while var_dump prints data type and values. Also, var_dump can be used for arrays and debugging.
