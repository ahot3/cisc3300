HTML is a markup language that we use to structure content on a webpage. The elements it defines such as headings, paragraphs, images and forms are used to create a webpage's layout.
Fordham.edu uses structure by providing a layout with directories to the most common things a student might need to access such as their mission, admissions, resources, student life, research and more. They also provide the latest news on the front page, and the website is designed to be tailored to catch someone's interest in Fordham life and eventually to apply to the school.
An HTML element is a structure (such as heading, paragraph, etc.) that consists of an opening tag <p> and a closing tag </p>, with whatever content you want to include in between it. An attribute provides more info about an element, such as the src attribute that we see within <img src ..
An element with semantic meaning means that its name clearly describes its purpose, such as <header> and <article>. An element with structural meaning means that its name does not necessarily describe the content’s meaning but it is used to “organize” and hence “structure” content on a webpage, such as <div>.
The default behavior is to send the form data to the server using the GET method, which usually causes the page to reload to another URL.
