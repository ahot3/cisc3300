1. The id attribute identifies just one element on a webpage, while the class attribute allows multiple elements to share the same styling or behavior. The id attribute does not allow two elements to share the same id.
2. The parts of a CSS rule include a selector, declaration block, properties and values.
3. CSS follows a cascading system which means that the rules are implemented based on importance, order and specificity. More important and specific selectors override less specific ones.
4. Display: block: makes an element take up the full width or “block” available.
Display: inline: allows elements to remain within the same line, taking up only the width that they need.
Display: inline-block: like display inline in that elements stay on the same line but also allows for setting width and height.
5. Border, padding and margin control spacing around elements and are part of the CSS box model.
Border: outermost layer providing a visible boundary.
Padding: space inside the border but around the content.
Margin: space outside the border, making space between the element and other elements.
