1. Both CSS Grid and Flexbox are modern layout systems which can help the user create responsive layouts to control the positioning and alignment of elements on a page. This is useful because it reduces the need for float-based positioning. Both use a parent-child relationship and offer properties for spacing and alignment. However, they differ in that FLexbox is best used for one-dimensional layouts along a single axis while CSS grid is best for two-dimensional layouts along both axes.
2. Responsive design ensures that a website adapts to different screen sizes, resolutions and devices which create for a flexible user experience. We implement responsive design by using flexible layouts such as Flexbox and CSS Grid, using media queries and using relative units (avoiding using fixed pixel sizes).
